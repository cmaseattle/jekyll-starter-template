A post in jekyll is written in Markdown syntax, which makes for easy writing since you do not have to look at HTML. All posts have a structured file format that gives files an order based on date.

Structure: `yyyy-mm-dd-post-title.markdown`

You can do all sorts of things in a post and all of it will regenerate into HTML when jekyll rebuilds the site based on file changes/updates.
